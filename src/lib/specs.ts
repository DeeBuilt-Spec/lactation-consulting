/*
 * Single source of truth for every design direction in this spec.
 *
 * Both the landing page (Index) and the in-bar SpecSwitcher read from here, so
 * the list, order, and labels never drift. To add a direction, add one entry —
 * it appears on the landing page and in the switcher automatically.
 *
 * Shape is intentionally generic so the shared spec-chrome bundle reuses it
 * across specs: drop in a new specs.ts + the chrome renders itself.
